A simple Portfolio using React

for this assignment i updated my portfolio using react components and functionality. When a prospective employer comes on this page, they are presented with a navigation bar containing Home, About me, my resume, links to my work and a contact section. they can navigate using those linkes to specific sections to view results.

Github is not creating a live link of this project for some reason. The live link is only displaying the read me. However, when i install the npm and start it on my local server i am able to see the webpage

i used JQuery
CSS
React
